A brief explanation:

My thought process and approach:
I take a header that says it is a "To Do List". I accept the green color as a symbol of positivity. 
Below the header is an input field and an add button to add things to the list. 
If anyone keeps the input field empty and clicks add, an error message will be shown. 
I highlighted the neighbor element of the list with different background colors.
The latest to do things will appear at the bottom considering that the task added before should finished before the last added one.
If one task is done, it can be kept under check marked.
One can delete any task by pointing the cursor at the cross icon right of the particular task row.


I keep it simple considering the time and my ability. No additional features are implemented.

How to run the application:

Download the full project on your Laptop/PC. Unzip the folder if it is zipped.
There are three files namely HTML, CSS, and Javascript files.
You need to double-click the html file to open it on your default browser.
Once it is opened on your browser you will able to use the application.
