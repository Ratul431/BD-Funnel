A brief explanation:

My thought process and aooroach:
I take a header that says it is a "To Do List". I take the green color as a symbol of positivity. 
Bellow the header there is an input field and an add button to add things in the list. 
If anyone keeps the input field empty and click add then an error message will be shown. 
I highlighted the neighbour element of the list with different backgound color.
Latest to do things will appear at the bottom considering that the task added before should finished before the last added one.
If one task is done, it can be keep under check marked.
One can delete any task by pointing the cursor at the cross icon right of the perticular task row.


I keep it simple considering the time and my ability. No additional features is implemented.
